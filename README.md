- Problem Statement: CoalaDraw is an open-source drawing and diagramming tool with easy real-time collaboration feature. It will be like [Web Whiteboard](https://webwhiteboard.com) and [draw.io](https://draw.io). While diagramming tools like draw.io is open-source and very powerful, they lack in collaboration and free-hand drawing. On the other hand, services like Web Whiteboard isn't open source and lacks few diagramming capabilities. Let's make our very own CoalaDraw to address these issues and add some wild features too.

Initially we will focus on adding good free-hand drawing capabilities and then we will focus on p2p/1:1 collaborative feature. After that, we will work in parallel about optimising our collaborative feature, making drawing tools better and adding diagramming capabilities.

AI/ML folks in the team (if any), will work on some exciting features as shape prediction, writing to text and even image to text/drawing/diagram.

Later, we can add texting/voice-chat feature in the app for smoother collaboration.

**Note:** These are all my train of thoughts. Feel free to think wild and come up with new features and I've surely missed.
